### Hi , I'm Dawar  Qureshi

I am an engineer and researcher in Water engineering. My work focuses on addressing overfitting challenges in water infrastructure, particularly, drainage systems. 
My research interests include uncertainty quantification in water infrastructure design,and pattern recognition in high dimensional environmental data. I am also interested in understanding how inherently non-linear hydrometeorological processes affect model calibration and optimisation. 
## Collaboration

I’m looking to collaborate on research projects in:
- Resilient Drainage Design   
- Flood risk modelling  
- Stochastic Computational Hydrology and Hydraulics.
