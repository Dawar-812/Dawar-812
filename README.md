- ### Hi there 👋, I'm Dawar  Qureshi

💧 **Engineer | Researcher | Computational Modeler | Data Analyst**

I focus on tackling real-world challenges in **water engineering**, **hydraulic engineering**, and **hydropower systems**.  
With a **B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering** and an **M.Sc. in Hydro Science & Engineering**, my interests and experience include:

- 🌊 **Hydraulic & Water Engineering** — dams, reservoirs, stormwater systems, and other water infrastructure
- 🌧️ **Flood Studies & Risk Assessment** — modelling flood behaviour and evaluating climate impacts on water systems
- 🖥️ **Computational Modelling & Data Analysis** — using numerical methods to understand flows and improve infrastructure performance
- 🌱 **Sustainable Engineering** — designing climate-resilient water infrastructure

I’m looking to **collaborate on open-source projects** and research ideas in **hydropower systems, flood risk modelling, and the design & operation of hydraulic infrastructure**.
